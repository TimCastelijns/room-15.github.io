# Android Room Rules

This repo is used to hold the room rules page for the [Stack Overflow Android chat room][room15].
The page is automatically generated by `travis` on every commit and automatically pushed to the repo.

Currently, the built rules are hosted at <http://room-15.github.io>.

## Contribute

If you want to add changes to the room rules, then just: fork the repository, make your changes in the <b>`body.md`</b> file, run `./build.sh` and send in a pull request.
Do *not* edit the `index.html` file. The `index.html` is created by the `build.sh` file.

For quick reference:

- `head.in` — this contains the top third of the output HTML, including the inline stylesheet and such.
- `tail.in` — the bottom third. Just closes off the remaining tags opened by the head.
- `body.md` — the rules text itself.
