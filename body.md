### How Can I Get Write Access?

<section markdown='1'>

You can request write access once you've joined the room. When a room owner is available, they will check to see if you can join. We have some criteria that you must meet before you're given access.

### Requirements for access:

- You should have at minimum 80 reputation on Stack Overflow.

- You should have contributed to Stack Overflow. For every 3 questions you have asked you should have provided at least 4 answers.

- You should not display obvious [help-vampire](http://slash7.com/2006/12/22/vampires/) qualities.

- You should not have a default username (e.g. user31415926). We prefer you to have a distinguishable name. User1234, user2341, and user3241 are hard to pick apart in discussions.


If you are denied access you should not request write access again before you have met the required criteria. Repeatedly requesting access is annoying and could very well get you banned from the room.

### What Are The Rules?

<section markdown='1'>

1. Before you ask a question here, first [thoroughly](http://stackoverflow.com/search) [research](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/search) [it](https://www.google.com) [yourself](http://www.ietf.org/rfc.html), and post it on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) (or another appropriate Stack Exchange site, like [programmers.se](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/)). We also expect you to read the [Android developer site](http://developer.android.com/) before asking a question about Android.

2. Use English and try to write well. This means no chat-speak (e.g., "u r vry gud i m new dev lol").

3. Don't paste blocks of code into the chat. Make a [gist] or use another pastebin if you must share code. Any code in the chatroom should be limited to one line at about 80 columns max.

4. Don't ping users (@username-ing) unless it's to clarify who you're speaking to or you need to get a specific person's attention. Pinging for help is bannable.

5. Everything kitty-related is allowed.

6. Your first message must be "I have read and understood the rules".

7. Images MUST be safe for work. Please don't post unprofessional images. Kitties and unicorns: okay. A screenshot of your app: sure. Twerking: no.

8. Don't flag messages you find personally offensive (e.g., swear words, blasphemy, and so on). It just annoys the people who have to respond to flags.

9. Only codeMagic is allowed to buy and drink [ass-Bourbon](http://sourmashmanifesto.com/2012/02/01/review-rebel-yell-bourbon/). Everyone else should [know better](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/transcript/message/19483807#19483807).

The choice to enforce the rules is at the discretion of each room owner. The rules are purposefully difficult to break, we just ask that you not be a dick. Cheers, have fun, and be excellent to one another.
